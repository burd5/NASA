<p>This application utilizes the NASA API to allow users to view the NASA picture or video of the day dating back to 1995. Includes a description that provides context for what the viewer is looking at. </p>

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

These NASA images are so incredible that I wanted to make sure they were the focal point of the webpage. The HTML is simple, just some headers, a form for searching, and space for the image descriptions at the bottom. For styling, I wanted to keep things simple as well. I used a black background to give it more of a "space" feel. I used a color picker to grab the hexidecimal values of the NASA logo and incorporated them into the header and button colors. The bulk of the JavaScript involved fetching the image and image description from the API. An event listener was added to the button that allowed the user to fetch data based on the specific date they entered. 

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

There are so many different directions and ways to build on this app. I would love to add a folder where website visitors can save their favorite pictures and images. To do this, I would first need to provide users the ability to create an account. I would also love to add a comment section so users can express their perspective on the photos and contribute other meaningful information to the conversation. However, I do want to retain the images as the focal point of the application. 

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
This was my first time working with an API. It allowed me to practice making fetch calls and writing out the fetch syntax. It also familiarized me with different query parameters and how developers use these paramaters to request certain information from the API. I realized how important the API documentation is in allowing developers to understand how to work with the API. Other API's I have used since were not as user friendly. I will be sure to use the NASA documentation as a template when I start to build out my own API's.
